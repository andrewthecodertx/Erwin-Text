# ErwinText

ErwinText is a simple, lightweight text editor built in C using the ncurses
library. It aims to provide a classic terminal-based editing experience with
essential features for developers and writers.

## Features

* **Syntax Highlighting:** Supports C, C++, Shell Scripts, JavaScript, HTML,
CSS, and XML.
* **File Management:** Create, open, and save files.
* **Basic Editing:** Insert, delete, and modify text.
* **Search:** Find text within a file.
* **Undo:** Revert recent changes.
* **Clipboard Integration:** Paste from the system clipboard (requires `xclip`
or `wl-paste`).
* **Mouse Support:** Click to position the cursor and use the scroll wheel.
* **Select All:** Select all text for quick deletion.

## Building

To build ErwinText, you'll need `ncurses` installed.

Then, simply run `make` in the project root directory:

```bash
make
```

This will create an executable named `erwintext`.

### Installation

To install ErwinText system-wide, run:

```bash
sudo make install
```

This will copy the `erwintext` executable to `/usr/local/bin`.

To uninstall, run:

```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

## Running

To run ErwinText, execute the following command:

```bash
./erwintext [filename]
```

Replace `[filename]` with the path to the file you want to open or create. If
no filename is provided, ErwinText will start with an empty buffer.
